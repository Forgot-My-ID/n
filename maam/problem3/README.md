Develop a “Remote Calculator” application that works as follows: The client program inputs
two integers and an arithmetic operation (‘*’,’/’,’%’,’+’,’-‘) from the user and sends these
three values to the server side. The server does the binary operation on the two integers and
sends backs the result of the operation to the client. The client displays the result to the user.
